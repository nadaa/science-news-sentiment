### About

Compute the sentiment polarity of the [Science news](https://www.sciencenews.org/all-stories).
I use Textblob liberary in Python to ocmpute the polarity of news headlines, which are categorized into either positive, negative, or neutral.

The goal is to build a simple complete end to end app  instead of a big uncomplete one.

The app contains the following:
- Web scraping
- Data processing
- Sentiment analysis 
- Visualization
- App deployment

### Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
